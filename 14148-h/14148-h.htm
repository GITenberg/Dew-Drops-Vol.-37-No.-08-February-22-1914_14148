    <p>"We're all such little girls, Miss Lee. We can't do things for people. They have
    to do things for us, all the time, don't you see? How can we do much helping?"</p>
    <p>Little Grace Mayne looked into her teacher's face with earnest eyes as she said
    this. The girls in the class nodded their heads and some of them added, "I don't see
    how," and "Of course we can't do anything," while they waited for Miss Lee to answer
    Gracie. The teacher had been talking to them about doing things for others, and had
    tried to show them how much help was needed in this world, and how much there was for
    all to do. Sunday-school teachers feel this so much, that no wonder they talk to
    their classes about it.</p>
    <p>"Well," said Miss Lee, as if she were thinking very deeply, indeed, "perhaps there
    is really nothing that you can do to help others. Doing, seems to be a hard word with
    you little maids. Suppose we drop that word and take another. A very great man once
    said that when we could do nothing, we could still be something, for the sake of
    other people. I would like to have you all see what you can be. That comes first,
    anyhow. You have to be alive before you can talk, and walk, and think, and act. You
    have to be willing before you can do anything, you know, and so we will see what we
    can do with ourselves, before we try to do much for others. Shall we?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, but I don't understand just what you mean," said Lucie Ray.</p>
    <p>"Then listen," said Miss Lee. "When anyone does anything for you, suppose you try
    to be truly thankful. When anyone teases you, see if you can be patient. If others
    are cross, see how kind you can be. When others are sour, you must be sweet. I really
    think you will have enough to do."</p>
    <p>"We'll try," said Grace.</p>
    <p>"That is right. Try, and keep on trying. There's one thing more: If you are
    thankful, say so. If you are sorry for anyone, say so, and if you feel kindly, speak
    kindly. These things ought to come out. But as you try to be patient and sweet, don't
    go about telling it. Let other people find it out. They will, easily enough."</p>
    <p>"How will they?" asked one.</p>
    <p>"The other day," said Miss Lee, "someone gave me a rose. It was an American
    Beauty. I put it in a vase in the parlor. There it stood, tall and straight, with its
    green leaves like lovely garments around it, and the crimson flower, like a beautiful
    crown above. Yes, there it stood, and never said a word. It never said, 'I am sweet.'
    or 'How fragrant my breath is!' not once. But everyone who came into the room, even
    when it happened to be dark, knew that the rose was there. Why?"</p>
    <p>"It was so sweet. They smelled it," cried the class in chorus.</p>
    <p>"Yes, that was it. By being sweet&mdash;not by saying, 'I am sweet'&mdash;it made
    itself known in the room. Now, see how sweet and loving and thankful and patient and
    thoughtful you can be this week. Think about being, instead of doing."</p>
    <p>The next Sunday they talked over the week.</p>
    <p>"I tried to be thankful and to say 'thank you,' when I ought," said Margie,
    "'cause mamma says so much to me about that. It was hard to remember always, but I
    tried."</p>
    <p>"I tried not to be cross with Rex," said Ruth. "He gets my things and I don't want
    him to. Sometimes I kept from being cross and sometimes I didn't. Once I slapped him,
    but I was sorry right away, and kissed him. Then he didn't cry."</p>
    <p>"To be sorry the minute we do wrong is one way to grow better," said Miss Lee.
    "Don't be discouraged."</p>
    <p>"Mamma said yesterday when she took Jack in the carriage and left me," said Grace,
    "that if I would make Nettie contented and happy, it would be better than anything I
    could do for her. So I played tea party with her, and was happy after a little
    minute, and mamma said 'Thank you!' when she came back. Then I was gladder
    still."</p>
    <p>"I seemed to have a chance to be sorry for people," said Fanny. "Mrs. Bailey, next
    door, had lots of trouble, and I went in and said softly, 'I'm so sorry. Mrs.
    Bailey!' and she said, 'That helps a great deal.'"</p>
    <p>After all this talk, and more words from Miss Lee, the girls made up their minds
    to keep on trying to please by being right, and being bright, and they found, as
    others may, that there is no surer way to give help and to do right.</p>

    <h3>SCHOOLTIME ANYTIME.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>When you have a hard lesson what do you do with it? Fret and complain over it?
    Look for someone to help you with it? Or do you brace up and tackle it bravely,
    bringing all your best effort to it.</p>

    </center>
    <br />

    <p>Snow did not cover the school yard at Hamlet so often as not to cause a great deal
    of excitement among the boys and girls, especially a deep snow&mdash;deep enough for
    making snowballs and forts and snowmen.</p>
    <p>So the day after the big snow that fell there one night, Mr. Newman, who had
    charge of the third grade boys of the Hamlet School, found it a hard day to keep
    order in his room; and a good many of the boys got low marks for the first time that
    term.</p>
    <p>How they did hate to leave the white school yard when the bell would put an end to
    the short recesses!</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus04.jpg' width='650'
      alt='How they did hate to leave the white school yard.' />
    </center>
    <p>"I think it's a pity we have to be shut up in the schoolhouse all the time and not
    get any good of it&mdash;when it doesn't snow here like this more than once till
    you're grownup," Mr. Newman heard one little fellow complain.</p>
    <p>Their teacher had liked to play in the snow as well as any of them when he was a
    boy, and he wished that he had not been obliged to ring the school bell and spoil
    their fun so soon.</p>
    <p>When it was time to dismiss school that day, Mr. Newman looked very solemn and
    said: "I think everyone of you boys deserves to be kept an hour more."</p>
    <p>The thirty young faces that looked up into his grew very solemn, too.</p>
    <p>Then their teacher smiled and said: "But instead of keeping you in, this time, I
    will keep you out. I give every boy in the room permission to stay one hour after
    school and play in the snow."</p>
    <p>Thirty happy small boys went bounding out into the white school yard.</p>
    <p>While they were building a snow fort and storming it with cannon-balls of snow,
    their teacher wrote their "excuses"&mdash;one to be carried by each boy when he went
    home from school an hour late.</p>
    <p>When the joyous hour was over, Mr. Newman rang the bell and the boys came up to
    the schoolhouse and were given their excuses. They thought it very funny to be kept
    "out" an hour after school, instead of being kept "in," and to carry an excuse home
    instead of to school.</p>
    <p>"We will have poor lessons every day, if you will punish us this way, Mr. Newman,"
    said one of the biggest boys.</p>
    <p>"This kind of punishment is given only when a six-inch snow covers the school yard
    at Hamlet," said the teacher.</p>
    <p>The boys all went happily home with cold noses and fingers and toes, but warm
    hearts for their teacher, whom they were beginning to think was the greatest man they
    knew.</p>
    <p>"I tell you I'm going to be up on that geography and grammar to-morrow," said Fred
    Walton.</p>
    <p>"And I'm going to know how to do those examples to-morrow," said Leonard King.</p>
    <p>And the next day the boys all had extra good lessons, if the school yard was
    covered with trampled snow and the battered snow fort still under the trees.</p>
    <hr style='width: 65%;' />
    <h3>ELSIE'S ADVICE.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>"Now, Maud Anna Belinda," said Elsie, "I want you to sit up straight and listen to
    me. I have something to say to you; something you should be glad to hear."</p>
    <p>It was hardly worth while to ask Maud Anna Belinda to sit up straight, for she was
    already straight, indeed, with her hands hanging down stiffly at her sides, and her
    eyes right out in front of her.</p>
    <p>"I have some good advice to give you," Elsie went on, "for your manners. There's
    company manners and there's home-folks manners. Some people have very fine company
    manners, but their home-folks manners are horrid. They make all their smiles in
    company, and just have frowns and pouts and frets for the family; which of course,
    you know, is very unfair and not nice at all. Some people don't divide theirs up;
    they have manners that are just the same all the time. And this is a much better way,
    especially if they are a pleasant kind, my dear.</p>
    <p>"Some people get their manners at Paris, and some people's mothers tell them to
    them when they are young. But my dear Maud Anna Belinda, if you want yours to be good
    and lovely through and through, you must have a good and lovely heart that's full of
    kindness and best wishes to everybody. Those are the sort they have in heaven, and
    heaven's a better place to get them from than Paris, I guess.</p>
    <p>"So now I'm done. And I will give you a kiss to remember it by."</p>
    <p>If Maud Anna Belinda did not need Elsie's advice, that is not saying that some of
    us may not.</p>

    <p>"That boy looks like a gentleman," said poor little Harry, looking at that boy's
    nice clothes and then at his own poor ones.</p>
    <p>He got on a street car. Soon he gave up his seat to a woman, and picked up her
    gloves.</p>
    <p>"You're a little gentleman," she said.</p>

    <p>Ralph and Emma and little Paul were sitting in a big circle. There were others in
    the circle, too. There were the eight dolls, and the little wooden dog that squeaked,
    and the fuzzy little rabbit that squeaked, and the lop-eared toy donkey, and the tiny
    elephant that stood alone. So many toys, and yet nobody seemed happy but baby Paul,
    who was trying to swallow his two little thumbs.</p>

    </center>
    <br />

    <p>In the middle of the circle was a tray with little dishes, and Emma held a tiny
    cup in her hand, for the children were just finishing a make-believe dinner party
    that had water and two apples for refreshments.</p>
    <p>"Winter parties, when its raining outdoors, aren't much fun," grumbled Emma.</p>
    <p>"It'd be lots nicer if we could have our party outdoors, and pick apples off
    trees," grumbled Ralph.</p>
    <p>"Twees," echoed baby Paul, trying to swallow his thumbs.</p>
    <p>"It just rains and rains," said Emma dolefully.</p>
    <p>"Wains," echoed baby Paul.</p>
    <p>Baby Paul had stopped swallowing his thumbs. What was it he saw in Emma's face?
    Was everything so bad?</p>
    <p>"Yes, it just rains and rains," complained Ralph dolefully.</p>
    <p>Baby Paul looked at Ralph, and saw the same thing he had seen in Emma's face. Oh,
    thing's must be very bad when big brother and sister looked so sad! It must be nearly
    time to cry!</p>
    <p>Back of the children was a nice warm fire in the grate. The room was comfortable,
    but baby Paul missed something from the atmosphere. He could not have told what it
    was, but he began to whimper.</p>
    <p>"Don't you go to crying!" said Emma crossly. "It's bad enough to be shut in by the
    rain without your crying."</p>
    <p>Baby Paul cried softly to himself. Thumbs were no comfort now.</p>
    <p>Emma went over to the window. She looked dolefully out at the rain. By and by she
    saw a man going into a house on the corner. The man had a case with him.</p>
    <p>"Oh," said Emma to herself, "that's the doctor who went there yesterday! The Brown
    baby must be real sick."</p>
    <p>The doctor stayed a good while. By and by he came out again into the rain. Emma
    ran to the telephone in the next room, and telephoned to the Browns. Yes, the baby
    was very, very sick.</p>
    <p>Emma came back softly into the room where the fire burned so comfortably. Baby
    Paul was still crying softly to himself.</p>
    <p>"The Brown baby is dreadfully sick," said Emma softly. "Oh, dreadfully! Lizzie
    Brown was crying when I telephoned to her. They don't know whether the baby will
    live."</p>
    <p>Ralph and Emma looked at baby Paul. Both children had the same thought. Emma ran
    to baby Paul, and hugged him.</p>
    <p>"Oh, baby darling!" cried Emma. "Baby darling, I couldn't stand it if you were
    sick!"</p>
    <p>"Goo!" said baby Paul, looking at Emma's face. That ugly something that was in her
    face awhile ago was not there now. Baby Paul smiled. If big sister's face was all
    right what was there to cry about?</p>
    <p>Ralph went to the window and looked toward the Browns. Then Ralph went to baby
    Paul and hugged him. Baby Paul crowed for joy. Big brother's and sister's faces were
    all right!</p>
    <p>"You darling!" cried Emma. "Let's play menagerie for him, Ralph."</p>
    <p>So pretty soon the little elephant and the fuzzy rabbit and the wooden dog and the
    lop-eared donkey were being hurried about at so lively a rate that baby Paul crowed
    and shouted for joy. What fun it was to be a well baby, when big sister and big
    brother smiled at him! And the rain just poured outdoors! But everybody was
    happy.</p>

    <h3>A SCHOOLROOM SWEEP.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>The girls at Dorothy's school&mdash;the little ones as well as the big
    ones&mdash;had to do something that very few schoolgirls have to do nowadays, and
    that is to sweep the schoolroom&mdash;a large room that had to be swept every day
    after the closing hour.</p>
    <p>Do you think that you would like such a task? Well, some of the big girls at
    Dorothy's school didn't like it either; but little Dorothy and most of her little
    mates thought it was a great honor, and they liked to have their turn come to
    sweep.</p>
    <p>Dorothy had not been to school for quite one year, and the teacher had never
    appointed her to be one of the sweepers. Dorothy wondered why. She swept the porches
    at home, and mother said she did it well, too. She did so want to sweep the
    schoolroom when Amy Brown did, for there were always two of the small girls, each
    sweeping half of the room.</p>
    <p>Day after day the teacher called the names of those who were to perform the task.
    Day after day Dorothy listened with a fast-beating heart and was disappointed.</p>
    <p>One day Lena swept almost the entire floor alone. She was younger than Dorothy,
    too, but she did her work so poorly that the teacher had to do it over after Lena had
    gone. Dorothy knew, for she watched, hoping the teacher would tell her to do it.</p>
    <p>At last one rainy day there were but a few at school, and those who were there had
    recently swept the floor. As the teacher glanced around before making the usual
    appointment, she looked at Dorothy, and Dorothy turned red in the face with
    excitement. Perhaps the teacher thought the shy little girl was afraid to be called
    on; anyway, she passed her by and called on Lena Webb&mdash;Lena Webb and Amy
    Brown.</p>
    <p>Oh, oh! Dorothy could hardly keep from crying with disappointment, and Lena came
    near crying because she was asked again so soon.</p>
    <p>Dorothy stayed, waiting for Amy to walk home with her, and of course she watched
    the work.</p>
    <p>She looked with disapproval at the streaks of dust that Lena was leaving, and
    finally she pointed them out to Lena. She was astonished when Lena threw down her
    broom, and cried out, "You just sweep it yourself, Dorothy Wenning!"</p>
    <p>Before the teacher could interfere Dorothy snatched the broom,
    exclaiming&mdash;"All right&mdash;I just <i>love</i> to sweep!"</p>
    <p>The teacher said nothing, but she noticed how evenly and clean Dorothy was doing
    her work, and when the task was done she said to Dorothy, "My dear, you have done so
    very well to-day that I am going to appoint you and Amy to sweep again
    to-morrow."</p>
    <p>How happily and eagerly Dorothy skipped home to tell her mother that at last she
    had been allowed to sweep the schoolroom floor.</p>

    <h3>LITTLE WHITE RIDING-HOOD.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>In the New Year's box from Aunt Jo there was an unusually lovely present for
    Leslie. It was really two presents: a beautiful warm white coat and a black velvet
    hood, both trimmed with soft, white fur around the edges.</p>
    <p>Leslie was very happy, and hurried to put them on.</p>
    <p>"Oh, mother," she cried, looking at herself in the mirror, "I'm a Little White
    Riding-Hood instead of a red one!"</p>
    <p>"So you are!" said mother laughing. "I hope Granny Wolf will not eat you up."</p>
    <p>Leslie laughed, too, and clapped her hands. "Oh, I'll go and see Granny Graham and
    play she is the wolf, only she is ever so much too kind to eat anybody. I ought to

    <p>Mother gladly packed a basket with doughnuts and red apples, but Leslie was not
    satisfied. "I can take doughnuts any time, I'd like to take some of the oranges from
    Aunt Jo's box."</p>
    <p>Mother looked a little surprised. "Are you quite sure you can spare them, dear?
    You do not have oranges very often."</p>
    <p>"I'd like to," Leslie insisted earnestly. "I don't believe Red Riding-Hood was
    selfish, and I'm sure White Riding-Hood doesn't want to be."</p>
    <p>So mother put in three big yellow oranges, and Leslie ran down the hill with her
    basket. Granny Graham was a tiny, sweet old lady who lived in a tiny cottage at the
    foot of the hill.</p>
    <p>Leslie knocked at the door and a pleasant voice called, "Come in." Leslie opened
    the door and stood inside in her pretty furry things, feeling quite nice and shivery
    over even playing that Granny was a wolf.</p>
    <p>"Good-morning, Granny," she said, "I'm Little White Riding-Hood."</p>
    <p>"Good-morning, my dear," said Granny, smiling, "how nice you look."</p>
    <p>"Oh, Granny," cried Leslie, "'what bright eyes you've got!'"</p>
    <p>Granny's bright eyes twinkled with fun as she answered, "'The better to see you
    with'."</p>
    <p>Leslie giggled; that was just the way it went in the story. "'Oh. Granny,'" she
    went on playing, "'what long ears you have!'"</p>
    <p>"'The better to hear you with,'" answered Granny; which was all very funny because
    the ears peeping out from under Granny's cap were tiny like the rest of her, and did
    not hear any too well at best.</p>
    <p>After that, Leslie held her basket a bit tighter and said, "'Oh, Granny, what
    sharp teeth you've got!'"</p>
    <p>"'The better to eat you with,'" laughed Granny, "I'm sure you look quite sweet
    enough."</p>
    <p>Leslie ran over and put the basket in her lap. "The oranges are sweeter," she
    said, "please eat those instead."</p>
    <p>"All right," Granny agreed, "if you will give me a kiss with them, that will be
    next best to eating you."</p>
    <p>In her heart, Leslie thought it was much better, and while Granny Graham ate one
    of the oranges they both decided that the story of Little White Riding-Hood had a
    much pleasanter ending than the old one in Leslie's book.</p>

    <h3>Musical Hespie and Her Play.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>Little Hespie, the wood mouse, sang sometimes as long as nine minutes. Her song
    usually came forth when she was at play, or exercising in some way. One time she
    became especially delighted because her wheel squeaked when she turned it. You know
    how pleased a boy is when his hobbyhorse creaks. So Hespie, too, enjoyed the new
    noise; but it so drowned her pretty little warble that a drop of oil was put in the
    wheel to stop the creaky sound.</p>
    <p>Poor Hespie became quite excited over this change, and bit the wires of her wheel.
    So a plan was made to soothe poor mousie's feelings. A small strip of stiff paper was
    placed in such a way that it hit the wheel every time it turned and so made a nice
    little noise. Hespie forgot her trouble and worked at the wheel joyously, making the
    paper noise and singing her pretty song at the same time.</p>
    <p>If Hespie had not had her wheel to play with, her life would have been quite dull.
    One time her wheel was corked up so that she could not go inside. She became quite
    angry and ran in and out of her bed-box, hardly knowing what to do. Her rage did not
    last long, however, and she was soon frolicking about the cage and singing. The song
    sounded at first like the cooing of a dove; then it changed to quick notes more like
    the cuckoo; and, after that, the noise was like the tapping of Mr. Woodpecker on a
    tree.</p>
    <p>One of Hespie's favorite games, which she played with the children, they called
    "hauling in the lines." She seemed never to grow tired of it. The children would hold
    a long cotton cord, while Hespie sat upon her hind legs and pulled it in like a
    sailor, hand over hand. Then the children would pull it out again just to see her
    pull it in.</p>
    <p>Happy little Hespie often sang when she ate. One day a small twig with insects'
    eggs on it was handed to her. She sat up straight in her cunning way, took the twig
    in her hands, and held it in her mouth. While she nibbled, she sang; so that she
    looked very much like a little musician playing a fife.</p>

    another.</p>

    <h3>Encourage Your Child to Read.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>As early as possible let your children be encouraged to read, and see that they
    are provided with books and papers adapted to their capacity of mind. Some parents,
    be it said to their shame, consider money spent in this way as unnecessary or even
    wasted. A more erroneous idea of economy never existed. Books are great educators. A
    mother should be more careful to provide her children with good books than fine
    clothes; should spend more time in teaching and training them than in decking their
    bodies for show and display. Mothers, if you are obliged to practice economy, do not
    commence to save in your children's books and papers; let it be in something else
    first. While, however, the mind is being trained and improved, care should be taken
    that the spiritual part is not neglected. While your children are reading books by
    various authors, have a care that they do not neglect the reading of the Bible, the
    Book of books.</p>

    <h3>Treat Them Kindly.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>Most of us are fond of pets, and it would be hard to find the boy or girl who
    didn't want either a dog or a kitten. It is small wonder, for a dog is a very
    faithful friend, and anything more delightful than a tiny, fluffy kitten, full of fun
    and spirits, it would be hard to find. But sometimes these pets do not have a very
    easy time of it. Only a few days ago we saw a little boy out on the sidewalk with his
    kitten. He was enjoying himself, but the kitten wasn't, for he would pick it up and
    throw it across the yard, till poor pussy mewed pitifully. Now, if our boys and girls
    are going to have pets, they ought to learn to treat them very kindly, just as they
    would wish to be treated themselves.</p>
    <p>You may think, perhaps, that your dog belongs to you, and for that reason you can
    do with him just as you please. But do you ever stop to consider that Rover or Don
    may not enjoy being kicked and beaten and pulled about any more than you would if you
    were in his place? That is something that we must think about. We might have been
    born helpless, in the power of other and larger creatures. But it has pleased our
    Father to make us what we are, and to give us the power over his other creatures, and
    for that reason we should be very kind and gentle with them. He wishes us to be
    merciful, and so we have his promise that those who are merciful shall have mercy
    shown them, if ever they come to be in need of it. And then, that it may be very
    plain to us, he tells us that "the merciful man is merciful to his beast." That means
    that he is kind and gentle to all the creatures that he has anything to do with, to
    his horse and his cow, to his dog, and even to the tiny kitten that ties itself up
    into a ball, chasing its own tail. Isn't this promise worth trying for?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
